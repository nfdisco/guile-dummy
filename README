Guile Project Template
======================

A template for Guile projects.

This project is intended to be used as a template for other Guile
projects.

Layout
------

The project consists of

- Guile modules, in the module/ directory
- executable scripts, in the src/ directory
- build infrastructure, which relies on the GNU Autotools

Development
-----------

In order to use the project modules before they are installed, the
pre-inst-env script can be used.  For example,

    ./pre-inst-env guile

will start Guile with the appropriate load path, so that the modules
in the source tree can be found and loaded.

Build Process
-------------

Run the bootstrap script to generate the configure script and the rest
of the files that are used by the build process.

If the configure script is unable to find guild, you can specify the
location of the guild executable when calling the script

    ./configure GUILD=`which guild`

Once the source tree is configured, run

    make && make install

to compile and install the program.
